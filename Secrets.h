// The PICC master key.
// This 3K3DES or AES key is the "god key".
// It allows to format the card and erase ALL it's content (except the PICC master key itself).
// This key will be stored on your Desfire card when you execute the command "ADD {Username}" in the terminal.
// To restore the master key to the factory default DES key use the command "RESTORE" in the terminal.
// If you set the compiler switch USE_AES = true, only the first 16 bytes of this key will be used.
// IMPORTANT: Before changing this key, please execute the RESTORE command on all personalized cards!
// IMPORTANT: When you compile for DES, the least significant bit (bit 0) of all bytes in this key 
//            will be modified, because it stores the key version.
