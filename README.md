# Project details

This forked source code powers the [NFC Door Unlocker](https://hackaday.io/project/167724-nfc-door-unlocker) project I created for conveniently unlocking and auto-locking my dorm room's door during my first year of college at Cal Poly while living in the Red Brick residence halls, which have doors with a traditional brass key lock. View build details, pictures, and hardware source files at the link above.

# Fork information

Original code written by [Elm√º on CodeProject](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1096861/DIY-electronic-RFID-Door-Lock-with-Battery-Backup).

Forked by Keavon Chambers in 2016 to simplify the project (removing battery-related features) and customize parts of the code related to my project (servo motor lock actuation, status LED, and auto-locking when the door is shut).
